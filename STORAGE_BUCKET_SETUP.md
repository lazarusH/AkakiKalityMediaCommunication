## ‚úÖ Verify Setup

After creating all buckets:

1. Refresh your app
2. Try uploading an image in the article form
3. It should work now!

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Alternative: SQL Setup

You can also run this SQL in the SQL Editor:

\`\`\`sql
-- Enable storage
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

-- The buckets are created via UI, but you can verify with:
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets;

-- Add policies (if not added via UI)
-- For news-images bucket
CREATE POLICY "Public read access"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'news-images');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated upload"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'news-images');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated update"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'news-images');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated delete"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'news-images');

-- Repeat for gallery-images and files-and-forms buckets
\`\`\`

---

## üìù Current Bucket Names

Your app uses these exact names:
- ‚úÖ `news-images` - For article images
- ‚úÖ `gallery-images` - For gallery photos
- ‚úÖ `files-and-forms` - For downloadable files

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Bucket names must match exactly (including hyphens)!

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If you still get "Bucket not found":
1. Check bucket names match exactly
2. Verify buckets are set to **Public**
3. Check RLS policies are enabled
4. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### If uploads fail with permission error:
1. Verify you're logged in
2. Check RLS policies are correct
3. Make sure buckets have INSERT policy for authenticated users
