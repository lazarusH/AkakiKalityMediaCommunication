# PWA (Progressive Web App) Installation Feature

## ✅ Overview
Added complete PWA functionality with an install button in the navbar. Users can now install the website as an app on their devices for offline access and a native app-like experience.

---

## 🚀 **Features**

### **1. Install Button in Navbar**
- **Location:** Navbar (between "About" and "Admin" links)
- **Visibility:** Only shows when app is installable and not yet installed
- **Bilingual Support:**
  - Amharic: `📲 አፕ ጫን` (App Install)
  - English: `📲 Install App`
- **Animation:** Pulsing glow effect to attract attention
- **Icon:** 📲 Mobile phone emoji

### **2. Installed Badge**
- Shows `✓ ተጭኗል` (Installed) in Amharic or `✓ Installed` in English
- Green badge with checkmark
- Appears after successful installation
- Non-clickable (just a status indicator)

### **3. Offline Support**
- Service Worker caches essential files
- Works offline after first visit
- Automatic cache updates
- Faster load times on repeat visits

---

## 📁 **Files Created**

### 1. **PWA Manifest** (`frontend/public/manifest.json`)
```json
{
  "name": "Akaki Kality Subcity Administration",
  "short_name": "Akaki Kality",
  "description": "Official news platform",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#1a5490",
  "theme_color": "#1a5490",
  "icons": [...]
}
```

**Purpose:** Defines app metadata for installation

### 2. **Service Worker** (`frontend/public/service-worker.js`)
- Caches essential files (logo, manifest, homepage)
- Serves cached content when offline
- Auto-updates cache on version change
- Falls back to network for uncached resources

**Cache Strategy:** Cache-first, network fallback

### 3. **PWA Hook** (`frontend/src/hooks/usePWAInstall.js`)
```javascript
export const usePWAInstall = () => {
  // Detects if app is installable
  // Handles install prompt
  // Tracks installation status
  return { isInstallable, isInstalled, handleInstallClick }
}
```

**Features:**
- Listens for `beforeinstallprompt` event
- Detects if already installed
- Provides install handler function
- Tracks installation success

---

## 🎨 **Styling**

### Install Button
```css
.install-button {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f4b324 0%, #e09600 100%);
  animation: pulse 2s infinite;
  /* Golden/yellow gradient to stand out */
}
```

**Visual Effects:**
- ✅ Golden gradient background
- ✅ Pulsing glow animation
- ✅ Hover effect with enhanced shadow
- ✅ Smooth transitions

### Installed Badge
```css
.installed-badge {
  background: rgba(212, 237, 218, 0.9);
  color: #155724;
  border: 2px solid #28a745;
  /* Green success indicator */
}
```

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Service Worker Registration
**File:** `frontend/src/main.jsx`

```javascript
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')
      .then(registration => console.log('SW registered'))
      .catch(error => console.log('SW registration failed'))
  })
}
```

### PWA Detection Logic
1. Check if `beforeinstallprompt` event fires → App is installable
2. Check if `display-mode: standalone` → App is already installed
3. Show appropriate UI based on state

### Browser Support
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Full support)
- ✅ Firefox (Partial support)
- ✅ Safari iOS (Add to Home Screen)
- ✅ Android browsers (Full support)

## ✨ **Benefits**

### For Users:
- 📱 **App-like experience** - Fullscreen, no browser UI
- ⚡ **Faster loading** - Cached content loads instantly
- 🔌 **Works offline** - View cached pages without internet
- 🏠 **Home screen icon** - Quick access from device
- 💾 **Less data usage** - Cached content doesn't re-download
- 🔔 **Future: Push notifications** (can be added later)

### For Organization:
- 📈 **Increased engagement** - Users spend more time in app
- 💪 **Better retention** - Home screen presence increases visits
- 🎯 **Modern experience** - Appears professional and up-to-date
- 📊 **Analytics** - Track install rates and usage

---

## 🎯 **What Gets Cached**

### Essential Files (Always Cached):
- `/` - Home page
- `/logo.png` - Logo image
- `/manifest.json` - PWA manifest

### Dynamic Caching:
- Any page visited is automatically cached
- Images, CSS, and JS files are cached on first load
- API responses can be cached (future enhancement)

### Cache Strategy:
```
1. Try to serve from cache (fast)
2. If not in cache, fetch from network
3. Save network response to cache for next time
```

## 🔍 **Testing PWA Installation**

### Chrome DevTools:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to "Application" tab
3. Click "Service Workers" - Should show registered worker
4. Click "Manifest" - Should show manifest details
5. Check "Lighthouse" tab - Run PWA audit

### Manual Testing:
1. Visit the website
2. Wait a few seconds for install button to appear
3. Click install button
4. Confirm installation
5. Check if app appears in OS app list
6. Open installed app - should open in standalone mode
7. Test offline: Disconnect internet, reload app

### Mobile Testing (Android):
1. Visit site in Chrome
2. Look for "Add to Home Screen" banner or install button
3. Install app
4. Check home screen for app icon
5. Open app - should be fullscreen without browser UI

## 📊 **Installation Detection**

### How it Works:
```javascript
// Check if app is installed
const isInstalled = 
  window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches ||
  window.navigator.standalone // iOS

// Check if installable
window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (e) => {
  // App is installable
  showInstallButton()
})

// Detect successful installation
window.addEventListener('appinstalled', () => {
  // Installation complete
  showInstalledBadge()
})
```
